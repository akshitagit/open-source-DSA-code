This section is created for beginners who want to get started with learning Datastructures and Algorithms using Python.

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. 
And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
You can get started with python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.


# Steps to run the code samples-

 1. Download Python from [official site](https://github.com/mahawiki/BackToBasics-Hacktoberfest/tree/main/Python-basics-in-10-programs).
 2. Then from command prompt **cd into this directory**.
 3. Since Python is an interpreter, we don't have to compile these programs.
 4. To run programs- **python program_name.py**.
