/*
 Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

 You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

 Solution: 1. Runtime: O(n) — Moore voting algorithm: We maintain a current candidate and a counter initialized to 0. As we iterate the array, we look at the current element x:
 If the counter is 0, we set the current candidate to x and the counter to 1.
 If the counter is not 0, we increment or decrement the counter based on whether x is the current candidate.
 After one pass, the current candidate is the majority element. Runtime complexity = O(n).
 2. Runtime: O(n) — Bit manipulation: We would need 32 iterations, each calculating the number of 1's for the ith bit of all n numbers. Since a majority must exist, therefore, either count of 1's > count of 0's or vice versa (but can never be equal). The majority number’s ith bit must be the one bit that has the greater count.
