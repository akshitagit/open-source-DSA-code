/*
 Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
 n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
 Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 Note: You may not slant the container.

 Solution: From both sides to the center.
